# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner - Complete Study Guide

---

## DOMAIN 1: CLOUD CONCEPTS (24%)

### 1.1 What is Cloud Computing?

**Definition**: On-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

**Three Service Models:**
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: You manage OS, applications, data. AWS manages hardware, networking, virtualization.
  - Example: EC2, VPC
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: You manage applications and data. AWS manages everything else.
  - Example: Elastic Beanstalk, RDS
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Everything is managed by the provider.
  - Example: Gmail, Salesforce

### 1.2 Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. **Trade capital expense for variable expense**: No upfront costs, pay only for what you use
2. **Benefit from massive economies of scale**: Lower prices due to AWS's aggregate usage
3. **Stop guessing capacity**: Scale up or down as needed
4. **Increase speed and agility**: Deploy resources in minutes, not weeks
5. **Stop spending money on data centers**: Focus on business, not infrastructure
6. **Go global in minutes**: Deploy worldwide with few clicks

### 1.3 Cloud Computing Key Concepts

**Scalability**: Ability to handle increased load
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increase size (bigger EC2 instance)
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Increase number (more EC2 instances)

**Elasticity**: Automatically scale resources up/down based on demand

**High Availability**: System remains operational even during failures
- Multi-AZ deployments
- No single point of failure

**Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating even if components fail
- Built-in redundancy

**Agility**: Quickly develop, test, and launch applications
- Reduced time to market

### 1.4 AWS Global Infrastructure

**Regions**: Geographic areas with multiple data centers
- Currently 30+ regions worldwide
- Choose based on: compliance, latency, pricing, service availability

**Availability Zones (AZs)**: Isolated data centers within a Region
- Each region has minimum 3 AZs
- Connected with high-speed networking
- Deploy across multiple AZs for high availability

**Edge Locations**: Content delivery network (CDN) endpoints
- 400+ edge locations globally
- Used by CloudFront for caching
- Lower latency for end users

**Local Zones**: Extension of AWS Region closer to end users
- Ultra-low latency applications
- Example: Los Angeles Local Zone

**Key Concept**: Region > Availability Zones > Edge Locations

### 1.5 Deployment Models

**Public Cloud**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- No on-premises infrastructure
- Everything runs on cloud provider's hardware

**Private Cloud**: On-premises cloud infrastructure
- You own and manage it
- Example: Using OpenStack on your own servers

**Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private
- Some servers on-premises, some on AWS
- Connected via Direct Connect or VPN
- Use cases: Regulatory requirements, gradual migration

## DOMAIN 2: SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE (30%)

### 2.1 Shared Responsibility Model 

**AWS Responsibility: "Security OF the Cloud"**

- Virtualization layer
- Managed services (RDS, S3, Lambda)

**Customer Responsibility: "Security IN the Cloud"**
- Customer data
- Platform, applications, IAM
- Operating system, network, firewall configuration
- Client-side encryption
- Server-side encryption (file system and/or data)
- Network traffic protection

**Remember**: 
- AWS = Hardware, facilities, physical security
- You = Your data, access controls, configurations

### 2.2 Identity and Access Management (IAM) 

**IAM Users**: Individual people or services
- Permanent credentials
- Long-term access

**IAM Groups**: Collection of users
- Apply permissions to multiple users at once
- Example: Developers, Admins, Finance

**IAM Roles**: Temporary credentials for services or users
- No permanent credentials
- Assumed by EC2, Lambda, users, etc.
- More secure than storing access keys

**IAM Policies**: JSON documents defining permissions
- Attached to users, groups, or roles
- Effect: Allow or Deny
- Action: What can be done (e.g., s3:GetObject)
- Resource: Which resources (e.g., specific S3 bucket)

**IAM Best Practices:**
- Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for root account
- Never use root account for daily tasks
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Use roles instead of access keys when possible
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use password policies

**Key Terms:**
- **Authentication**: Who you are (username/password)
- **Authorization**: What you can do (policies)
- **Root User**: Account owner with full access - PROTECT IT!

- Access: IAM, credentials, MFA
- OS: Patching, configuration
- Network: Firewall rules, security groups
- Applications: Code, updates

### When to Use Which Service?

**Compute:**
- **EC2**: Need full control, specific OS, custom applications
- **Lambda**: Event-driven, short tasks, no server management
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Deploy apps quickly, don't want to manage infrastructure
- **ECS/EKS**: Containerized applications
- **Lightsail**: Simple, predictable pricing for small projects

**Storage:**
- **S3**: Object storage, static files, backups, data lakes
- **EBS**: Block storage for EC2, databases on EC2
- **EFS**: Shared file storage across multiple EC2
- **Storage Gateway**: Hybrid cloud, connect on-premises to AWS

**Database:**
- **RDS**: Relational, structured data, complex queries
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL, high performance, flexible schema
- **Aurora**: RDS but faster, more expensive
- **Redshift**: Data warehousing, analytics
- **ElastiCache**: In-memory caching for speed

**Networking:**
- **VPC**: Isolated network environment
- **CloudFront**: CDN, cache content globally
- **Route 53**: DNS, domain management
- **Direct Connect**: Dedicated connection from on-premises

**Security:**
- **IAM**: Access control, users, roles
- **GuardDuty**: Threat detection
- **Inspector**: EC2 vulnerability assessment
- **Macie**: Find sensitive data in S3
- **WAF**: Web application firewall
- **Shield**: DDoS protection

### Question Pattern Recognition

**"Cost-effective solution"** → Look for:
- Spot Instances
- S3 Glacier
- Reserved Instances
- Right-sizing recommendations

**"High availability"** → Look for:
- Multi-AZ deployments
- Load balancers
- Auto Scaling
- Multiple regions

**"Serverless"** → Look for:
- Lambda
- DynamoDB
- S3
- API Gateway
- Fargate

**"Hybrid cloud"** → Look for:
- Storage Gateway
- Direct Connect
- VPN
- AWS Outposts

**"Real-time"** → Look for:
- Kinesis
- DynamoDB

**"Audit/Compliance"** → Look for:
- CloudTrail
- Config
- AWS Artifact
- CloudWatch Logs

**"Disaster recovery"** → Look for:

### Common Traps to Avoid

1. **Don't confuse:**
   - S3 vs EBS vs EFS
   - RDS vs DynamoDB
   - Security Groups vs NACLs
   - CloudWatch vs CloudTrail
   - GuardDuty vs Inspector vs Macie

2. **Remember:**
   - Data IN to AWS is free
   - You can't attach one EBS to multiple EC2
   - Root user should have MFA and shouldn't be used daily
   - IAM is global (not region-specific)

3. **Shared Responsibility:**
   - AWS = infrastructure, hardware, managed services
   - You = data, access, configuration, encryption

4. **Support Plans:**
   - Only Business and above get full Trusted Advisor
   - Only Enterprise gets TAM
   - Response times decrease with higher plans

### Elimination Strategy

When unsure:
1. Eliminate clearly wrong answers
2. Look for AWS-specific service names
3. Choose managed service over self-managed
4. Choose serverless when possible for "simplest solution"
5. Choose cost-effective = cheaper storage class, Reserved/Spot instances
